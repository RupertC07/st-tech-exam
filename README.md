## Machine Problems 1 & 2

1. **Machine Problem 1**
   The `partsSums` function calculates the sum of an array and then iteratively computes and returns a list of sums of its remaining parts, ending with 0. If the array is empty, it returns `[0]`.

    **Run this:**
    ```shell
    npm run mp:1

2. **Machine Problem 2**
  The `calculateEarnings` function computes total earnings based on daily expeditions by calculating the number of bottles collected and their earnings. It then compares the average earnings per day to daily             expenses to determine if there is extra money or if more funds are needed.

    **Run this:**
    ```shell
        npm run mp:2
